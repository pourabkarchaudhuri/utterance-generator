## Description
This project uses a package of Node.JS called NaturalJS which is the javascript equivalent of Python's famous NLTK package. Thi takes an input as CSV and gives output both as .txt and .csv files.

## Inspiration
This project is more like an accelerator in building bigger chatbots, voice bots, alexa skills, etc where the developer has to go and give multiple sentences to train the bot. This makes their life much easier. The module can be RESTified using express and even extended to possibly autotrain and autogenerate sentences for re-enforcement learning?

### Technology

Oversight uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Node.JS] - A server-side javascript framework

#### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pourabkarchaudhuri/utterance-generator.git
$ cd utterance-generator
```
#### Folder Structure
Open the sample input.csv file and replace words

```sh
$ node index.js
```
Voila!
